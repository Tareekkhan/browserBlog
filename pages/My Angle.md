# My Angle (WaterWays)

Finding trails and parks is easy with many applications and websites providing up to date information. Finding information of bodies of water near you however proves to be more difficult. The WaterWays app prototype is a tool developed to help bridge this divide and provide accurate information for those that love being on or near the water or would just like to be more informed. For instance, frequently used near bodies of water is chlorine for disinfecting water supplies. People that have been around chlorine for more than 30 years have been found to have a higher chance of getting bladder cancer compared to those that have been around chlorine less than 10 years (King 596-604). The main audience I am targeting is 25-45 year olds. The information we gather today is immense but do we really have the information we need from that? The prototype is for those that don't have all the information when it comes to visiting lakes, swimming areas, etc. 

The reason i am targeting 25-45 year olds is because this generation is more prone to seek information on areas they are spending time as well as determining patterns for longevity. With this in mind, I seek to give access to needed information for those that will benefit from it.
